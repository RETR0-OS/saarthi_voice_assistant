# Problem Statement 2: Unlocking Access – The Digital Companion for Social Welfare  

## Backstory  
Priya lives in a remote town, far from the nearest government office. She qualifies for welfare schemes that could change her life, but accessing them is a struggle. Confusing forms, language barriers, repeated trips, and shifting rules make every attempt exhausting. She doesn’t speak English, and complex apps feel overwhelming. For Priya, the process isn’t just hard—it’s discouraging. The help exists, but the system is locked behind walls she can’t cross alone.  

## The Challenge  
Can you create an AI-powered digital companion that turns government services into a welcoming, accessible experience for everyone, regardless of language or digital literacy?  

## Your Mission  
Build a platform that guides users like Priya. It should:  
- Answer questions in their language.  
- Provide clear step-by-step help.  
- Simplify applying for welfare schemes.  
- Eliminate jargon, confusion, and unnecessary travel.  
- Offer a voice-first, intuitive experience, even for those who’ve never used a smartphone app.  

## What Your AI Agent Should Be Able to Do  
1. **Conversational Understanding**  
   - Listen and respond naturally in the user’s preferred language or dialect.  
   - Recognize intent even when questions are unclear or incomplete.  

2. **Personalized Guidance**  
   - Identify eligible schemes based on the user’s situation.  
   - Guide users through the application process with simple instructions.  

3. **Voice-First Accessibility**  
   - Enable full interaction via voice—no reading, typing, or complex menus required.  

4. **Document Assistance**  
   - Explain required documents.  
   - Help users track what they have and remind them of missing items.  

5. **Cultural Sensitivity**  
   - Communicate with empathy and patience.  
   - Build trust and confidence for users new to digital tools.  

## Bonus Features  
- Allow users to save progress and resume later.  
- Provide real-time updates on application status via voice.  
- Offer a “family mode” to assist with applying for benefits on behalf of others.
